### What is Hyperopt-sklearn?
Finding the right classifier to use for your data can be hard. Once you have chosen a classifier, tuning all of the parameters to get the best results is tedious and time consuming. Even after all of your hard work, you may have chosen the wrong classifier to begin with. Hyperopt-sklearn provides a solution to this problem.
